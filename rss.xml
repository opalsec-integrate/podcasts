      <description><![CDATA[Dive into the latest cyber security developments with stdout. Today, we unpack a <b>high-severity vulnerability</b> impacting MongoDB: <i>CVE-2025-14847</i>. Rated <b>CVSS 8.7</b>, this flaw allows unauthenticated clients to read uninitialised heap memory, potentially exposing sensitive in-memory data. 🚨

We analyse the technical specifics: the issue stems from <i>improper handling of length parameter inconsistency</i> within Zlib compressed protocol headers. Mismatched length fields can lead to the disclosure of internal state information or pointers, which could significantly aid further exploitation. 🕵️‍♂️

Are your MongoDB deployments at risk? We detail the <b>affected versions</b>, including 8.2.0-8.2.3, 8.0.0-8.0.16, 7.0.0-7.0.26, 6.0.0-6.0.26, 5.0.0-5.0.31, 4.4.0-4.4.29, and all 4.2, 4.0, and 3.6 series. ⚠️ Crucially, <b>patches are available</b> in versions 8.2.3, 8.0.17, 7.0.28, 6.0.27, 5.0.32, and 4.4.30. If immediate patching isn't feasible, we discuss the recommended mitigation: disabling zlib compression on your MongoDB Server. 🛠️]]></description>

Discover their sophisticated techniques, including custom encryption and payloads disguised as PNGs, targeting entities in Türkiye, China, and India.

🤖 **AI in Cyber Warfare:** The accelerating pace of AI-driven attacks demands a strategic shift. We explore how threat actors exploit vulnerabilities within minutes and the critical need for defenders to leverage AI in defence. Plus, re-evaluate your tabletop exercises to simulate AI-powered attacks, including prompt injection and data exfiltration, and discover the importance of 'analog friction' for critical actions.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>🚨 <b>stdout: Daily Cyber Threat Briefing</b> 🚨</p>

<p>"Operation WrtHug," a China-linked campaign, has compromised 50,000 end-of-life ASUS WRT routers for suspected espionage. Globally, "ShadowRay 2.0" is cryptojacking over 230,000 Ray AI clusters by exploiting a critical RCE (CVE-2023-48022, CVSS 9.8). Major data breaches impacting 62 million students via PowerSchool and a Russian insurer, alongside a $25 million crypto laundering conviction, also feature in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Uncover new attack vectors and threat intelligence: China-linked APT "PlushDaemon" is deploying the Go-based EdgeStepper implant for adversary-in-the-middle attacks, facilitating extensive data theft. Learn about a critical vulnerability in ServiceNow's Now Assist AI allowing second-order prompt injection, and a Python-based WhatsApp worm spreading the Eternidade Stealer across Brazilian devices. Amazon Threat Intelligence warns of "cyber-enabled kinetic targeting" by nation-states, while MI5 alerts on Chinese intelligence recruitment in UK democratic institutions.</p>

<p>Stay ahead of actively exploited vulnerabilities: Fortinet warns of an OS command injection (CVE-2025-58034) in FortiWeb, now on CISA's KEV catalogue. A symbolic link-based RCE (CVE-2025-11001) in 7-Zip is under active exploitation, and a critical PHP command injection (CVE-2025-9501) in the W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin allows unauthenticated RCE.</p>

<p>Finally, we examine critical data privacy and regulatory shifts: WhatsApp's enumeration flaw exposed 3.5 billion user records, while the Airlines Reporting Corporation ceases selling travel data to government agencies. The temporary expiration of CISA 2015 raises concerns, and the US, UK, and Australia sanction Russian bulletproof hosting provider Media Land. The EU's proposed "Digital Omnibus" package could significantly reshape GDPR and AI Act regulations, potentially rolling back privacy protections.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>🚨 <b>Critical Alert: Cisco IOS XE Under Siege!</b> 🚨</p>
<p>Active exploitation of <b>CVE-2023-20198</b>, a critical 10.0 CVSS vulnerability, is impacting unpatched Cisco IOS XE devices. China-linked threat actors, including Salt Typhoon, are weaponising the low-equity BADCANDY Lua-based web shell to create privileged accounts and seize control. An urgent ASD bulletin highlights hundreds of Australian devices compromised since late 2023. Essential hardening guidelines are crucial to protect infrastructure from re-infection.</p>

<p>📧 A politically motivated cyber incident at the University of Pennsylvania saw an offensive email targeting thousands of students, highlighting potential email system compromises and data breach threats. This bears hallmarks of similar attacks following the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling.</p>

      <title>Daily News Update: Monday, September 22, 2025</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>🚨 On this episode of stdout, we're diving deep into two critical cybersecurity developments:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Entra ID Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55241):</strong> Discover how a critical flaw, leveraging undocumented "actor tokens" and a deprecated API, could have granted Global Administrator privileges across any Entra ID tenant globally. Learn about the stealthy exploitation potential and Microsoft's swift patch.</li>
</ul>

<p>🇰🇵 We then pivot to the evolving tactics of North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups, including Lazarus, ScarCruft (APT37), and Kimsuky (APT43). Expect insights into:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sophisticated Social Engineering:</strong> How "ClickFix" lures in fake cryptocurrency job scams deliver malware like BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, with expanded targeting beyond software developers.</li>
    <li><strong>ScarCruft's Shift:</strong> A notable move from pure espionage to financially motivated and potentially destructive operations, deploying VCD ransomware for the first time, alongside new tools like the Rust-based CHILLYCHINO and FadeStealer. 💸</li>
    <li><strong>Kimsuky's Innovation:</strong> Abuse of GitHub repositories for malware delivery and data exfiltration, plus their alarming use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to forge deepfake military ID cards in spear-phishing campaigns targeting South Korean defence entities. 🤖</li>
</ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>🚨 stdout uncovers a critical <b>zero-click vulnerability</b>, codenamed <i>ShadowLeak</i>, in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent. Crafted emails leveraging <b>indirect prompt injection</b> could exfiltrate sensitive Gmail inbox data directly from OpenAI's cloud infrastructure, bypassing traditional client-side defences. This flaw, now patched, highlights risks with enabled third-party integrations. 📧</p>

<p>Next, we expose a widespread campaign targeting macOS users with the potent <b>Atomic Stealer malware</b>. Threat actors are deploying <b>fake GitHub repositories</b> impersonating legitimate tools like LastPass and 1Password, using <b>SEO poisoning</b> to push malicious downloads. This campaign underscores persistent social engineering and supply chain compromise tactics. 💻</p>

<p>Finally, a significant regulatory crackdown: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has shut down the <b>TradeOgre cryptocurrency exchange</b>, seizing over $40 million. This marks Canada's first crypto exchange shutdown, driven by failures in FINTRAC registration and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, making it a conduit for cybercrime money laundering. 💰</p>]]></description>
