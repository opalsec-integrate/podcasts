      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® <b>stdout: Your 24-Hour Cyber Brief</b> üö®</p>
<p>Get the essential intel for cyber security analysts. Today, we're dissecting critical vulnerabilities and active threat campaigns from the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>First, a deep dive into Oracle's E-Business Suite. Oracle has issued an urgent alert for <b>CVE-2025-61884</b> (CVSS 7.5), a high-severity flaw allowing unauthenticated, remote HTTP access to compromise Oracle Configurator. This vulnerability grants attackers unauthorised access to critical data across versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. We also revisit the recently exploited zero-day, <b>CVE-2025-61882</b>, leveraged by Cl0p-linked threat actors to deploy malware families including GOLDVEIN.JAVA, SAGEGIFT, SAGELEAF, and SAGEWAVE.</p>

<p>Next, we pivot to a pervasive smishing campaign targeting New Yorkers. Fraudulent text messages impersonating the Department of Taxation and Finance are luring recipients with fake "Inflation Refunds" to steal sensitive personal and financial data for identity theft and fraud. Official warnings confirm New York State's actual refund initiative is automatic, with agencies explicitly stating they will not contact taxpayers via text, phone, or email for these refunds.</p>

<p>Tune in for a concise summary of active cyber events, new techniques, and exploited vulnerabilities.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® Get the daily rundown on critical cyber security developments! Today, we're dissecting a widespread compromise impacting **SonicWall SSL VPN devices**, where threat actors are rapidly authenticating into over 100 accounts, potentially leveraging valid credentials and exploiting known flaws, including **CVE-2024-40766**, linked to Akira ransomware campaigns. We'll cover crucial mitigation advice for organisations.</p>

<p>üõ†Ô∏è Next, we delve into new threat research revealing threat actors weaponising the open-source DFIR tool **Velociraptor** in ransomware attacks. The group Storm-2603 exploits **SharePoint vulnerabilities** for initial access, deploying an outdated Velociraptor version susceptible to **CVE-2025-6264** for privilege escalation and endpoint takeover. We detail their lateral movement tactics, including GPO modifications and disabling real-time protection.</p>

<p>‚öñÔ∏è We also cover the legal fallout from the **PowerSchool breach**, where a 19-year-old faces a seven-year prison term for accessing 60 million student and 9 million teacher records and demanding a 30 Bitcoin ransom.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® On this episode of stdout, we're diving deep into two critical cybersecurity developments:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Entra ID Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55241):</strong> Discover how a critical flaw, leveraging undocumented "actor tokens" and a deprecated API, could have granted Global Administrator privileges across any Entra ID tenant globally. Learn about the stealthy exploitation potential and Microsoft's swift patch.</li>
</ul>

<p>üá∞üáµ We then pivot to the evolving tactics of North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups, including Lazarus, ScarCruft (APT37), and Kimsuky (APT43). Expect insights into:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sophisticated Social Engineering:</strong> How "ClickFix" lures in fake cryptocurrency job scams deliver malware like BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, with expanded targeting beyond software developers.</li>
    <li><strong>ScarCruft's Shift:</strong> A notable move from pure espionage to financially motivated and potentially destructive operations, deploying VCD ransomware for the first time, alongside new tools like the Rust-based CHILLYCHINO and FadeStealer. üí∏</li>
    <li><strong>Kimsuky's Innovation:</strong> Abuse of GitHub repositories for malware delivery and data exfiltration, plus their alarming use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to forge deepfake military ID cards in spear-phishing campaigns targeting South Korean defence entities. ü§ñ</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® stdout uncovers a critical <b>zero-click vulnerability</b>, codenamed <i>ShadowLeak</i>, in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent. Crafted emails leveraging <b>indirect prompt injection</b> could exfiltrate sensitive Gmail inbox data directly from OpenAI's cloud infrastructure, bypassing traditional client-side defences. This flaw, now patched, highlights risks with enabled third-party integrations. üìß</p>

<p>Next, we expose a widespread campaign targeting macOS users with the potent <b>Atomic Stealer malware</b>. Threat actors are deploying <b>fake GitHub repositories</b> impersonating legitimate tools like LastPass and 1Password, using <b>SEO poisoning</b> to push malicious downloads. This campaign underscores persistent social engineering and supply chain compromise tactics. üíª</p>

<p>Finally, a significant regulatory crackdown: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has shut down the <b>TradeOgre cryptocurrency exchange</b>, seizing over $40 million. This marks Canada's first crypto exchange shutdown, driven by failures in FINTRAC registration and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, making it a conduit for cybercrime money laundering. üí∞</p>]]></description>
