      <title>Daily News Update: Monday, September 22, 2025</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® On this episode of stdout, we're diving deep into two critical cybersecurity developments:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Entra ID Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55241):</strong> Discover how a critical flaw, leveraging undocumented "actor tokens" and a deprecated API, could have granted Global Administrator privileges across any Entra ID tenant globally. Learn about the stealthy exploitation potential and Microsoft's swift patch.</li>
</ul>

<p>üá∞üáµ We then pivot to the evolving tactics of North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups, including Lazarus, ScarCruft (APT37), and Kimsuky (APT43). Expect insights into:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sophisticated Social Engineering:</strong> How "ClickFix" lures in fake cryptocurrency job scams deliver malware like BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, with expanded targeting beyond software developers.</li>
    <li><strong>ScarCruft's Shift:</strong> A notable move from pure espionage to financially motivated and potentially destructive operations, deploying VCD ransomware for the first time, alongside new tools like the Rust-based CHILLYCHINO and FadeStealer. üí∏</li>
    <li><strong>Kimsuky's Innovation:</strong> Abuse of GitHub repositories for malware delivery and data exfiltration, plus their alarming use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to forge deepfake military ID cards in spear-phishing campaigns targeting South Korean defence entities. ü§ñ</li>
</ul>]]></description>

      <title>Daily News Update: Sunday, September 21, 2025</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® stdout uncovers a critical <b>zero-click vulnerability</b>, codenamed <i>ShadowLeak</i>, in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent. Crafted emails leveraging <b>indirect prompt injection</b> could exfiltrate sensitive Gmail inbox data directly from OpenAI's cloud infrastructure, bypassing traditional client-side defences. This flaw, now patched, highlights risks with enabled third-party integrations. üìß</p>

<p>Next, we expose a widespread campaign targeting macOS users with the potent <b>Atomic Stealer malware</b>. Threat actors are deploying <b>fake GitHub repositories</b> impersonating legitimate tools like LastPass and 1Password, using <b>SEO poisoning</b> to push malicious downloads. This campaign underscores persistent social engineering and supply chain compromise tactics. üíª</p>

<p>Finally, a significant regulatory crackdown: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has shut down the <b>TradeOgre cryptocurrency exchange</b>, seizing over $40 million. This marks Canada's first crypto exchange shutdown, driven by failures in FINTRAC registration and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, making it a conduit for cybercrime money laundering. üí∞</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® <b>stdout: Your Daily Cyber Briefing</b> üö®</p>
<p>Dive deep into the last 24 hours of cybersecurity with "stdout"! We're breaking down 12 critical topics for technical analysts, focusing on active cyber events, exploited vulnerabilities, and emerging threat techniques. üá¶üá∫</p>

<p>This episode, we cover the <b>arrests of two Scattered Spider affiliates</b> in the UK, linked to over $115 million in ransoms and a US federal court breach. We also track a <b>cyberattack on Russia's Pulkovo Airport</b> and an Iran-nexus group, UNC1549, infiltrating 11 European telecommunications companies via LinkedIn lures and the MINIBIKE backdoor. ‚úàÔ∏è</p>

<p>On the vulnerability front, Fortra warns of a <b>max-severity deserialisation flaw (CVE-2025-10035)</b> in GoAnywhere MFT, mirroring a past Clop zero-day. CISA details malware exploiting <b>Ivanti EPMM zero-days (CVE-2025-4427, CVE-2025-4428)</b>, potentially by China-nexus groups. Plus, discover a critical, now-mitigated <b>Microsoft Entra ID flaw (CVE-2025-55241)</b> that could have granted global admin access, and OpenAI's patch for <b>ChatGPT's "ShadowLeak"</b>, allowing Gmail secret exfiltration. üí•</p>

<p>New threat research reveals <b>collaboration between Russian state-sponsored groups Gamaredon and Turla</b>, with Gamaredon providing initial access for Turla's Kazuar backdoor. Uncover China's "AI persona army" for information warfare and the surge in <b>Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platforms like Lighthouse and Lucid</b>, driving 17,500+ phishing domains. We also explore how researchers tricked ChatGPT into solving CAPTCHAs, raising questions about their long-term effectiveness. ü§ñ</p>

<p>Beyond the exploits, MI6 launches a <b>dark web portal "Silent Courier"</b> for informant recruitment, the FBI warns of fake IC3 portals, and the future of the CVE Program is debated amidst funding concerns. Stay ahead with stdout! üí°</p>]]></description>
