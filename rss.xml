Also, a former defence contractor exec faces charges for selling trade secrets to Russia.</p>

<p>Explore the latest in threat research and techniques: the Qilin ransomware group is escalating attacks with Linux variants on Windows, BYOVD exploits, and Veeam targeting. Kaspersky links Memento Labs (Hacking Team successor) to Operation ForumTroll, exploiting a Chrome zero-day (CVE-2025-2783) for "Dante" spyware. We detail Lazarus Group's "Operation Dream Job" targeting European defence, MuddyWater's Phoenix backdoor distribution, and the RedTiger tool's exploitation for data theft. Learn about new XWorm 6.0 features, Microsoft 365 Exchange Online Direct Send abuse, "CoPhish" OAuth token theft via Copilot Studio, and LockBit 5.0's multi-platform resurgence. Advanced phishing evasion techniques, including JavaScript-driven SEG bypasses and QR codes in PDFs, are also on our radar.</p>

<p>Stay ahead of critical vulnerabilities: a Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) RCE (CVE-2025-59287) is under active exploitation, prompting an emergency patch. We detail "TARmageddon" (CVE-2025-62518) in the async-tar Rust library, allowing RCE and supply chain attacks, and a critical ASP.NET Core security bypass (CVE-2025-55315) in QNAP NetBak PC Agent. OpenAI's Atlas web browser is vulnerable to prompt injection via its omnibox, and multiple unpatched flaws in EfficientLab's WorkExaminer Professional allow unauthenticated administrative access.</p>]]></description>

<p>Get the essential intel for cyber security analysts. Today, we're dissecting critical vulnerabilities and active threat campaigns from the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>First, a deep dive into Oracle's E-Business Suite. Oracle has issued an urgent alert for <b>CVE-2025-61884</b> (CVSS 7.5), a high-severity flaw allowing unauthenticated, remote HTTP access to compromise Oracle Configurator. This vulnerability grants attackers unauthorised access to critical data across versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. We also revisit the recently exploited zero-day, <b>CVE-2025-61882</b>, leveraged by Cl0p-linked threat actors to deploy malware families including GOLDVEIN.JAVA, SAGEGIFT, SAGELEAF, and SAGEWAVE.</p>

<p>Next, we pivot to a pervasive smishing campaign targeting New Yorkers. Fraudulent text messages impersonating the Department of Taxation and Finance are luring recipients with fake "Inflation Refunds" to steal sensitive personal and financial data for identity theft and fraud. Official warnings confirm New York State's actual refund initiative is automatic, with agencies explicitly stating they will not contact taxpayers via text, phone, or email for these refunds.</p>

<p>Data privacy takes centre stage with patients advocating for stronger neural data rights as scientists decode inner speech from Brain Computer Interface (BCI) implants. üß† Regulatory hurdles loom as CISA 2015 faces expiration, potentially increasing cyber risk, and Senator Tom Cotton proposes an 18-month 'clean' reauthorization of FISA Section 702 amidst privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Finally, the US government mandates a transition to NIST's new post-quantum cryptography standards by 2030/2035 to counter 'harvest now, decrypt later' threats. üîí ICE HSI has acquired Magnet Forensics' Graykey software for device unlocking. Plus, Mozilla introduces a new Firefox feature allowing add-on developers to roll back to previous approved versions for quicker bug fixes. ü¶ä</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® On this episode of stdout, we're diving deep into two critical cybersecurity developments:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Entra ID Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55241):</strong> Discover how a critical flaw, leveraging undocumented "actor tokens" and a deprecated API, could have granted Global Administrator privileges across any Entra ID tenant globally. Learn about the stealthy exploitation potential and Microsoft's swift patch.</li>
</ul>

<p>üá∞üáµ We then pivot to the evolving tactics of North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups, including Lazarus, ScarCruft (APT37), and Kimsuky (APT43). Expect insights into:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Sophisticated Social Engineering:</strong> How "ClickFix" lures in fake cryptocurrency job scams deliver malware like BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, with expanded targeting beyond software developers.</li>
    <li><strong>ScarCruft's Shift:</strong> A notable move from pure espionage to financially motivated and potentially destructive operations, deploying VCD ransomware for the first time, alongside new tools like the Rust-based CHILLYCHINO and FadeStealer. üí∏</li>
    <li><strong>Kimsuky's Innovation:</strong> Abuse of GitHub repositories for malware delivery and data exfiltration, plus their alarming use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to forge deepfake military ID cards in spear-phishing campaigns targeting South Korean defence entities. ü§ñ</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>üö® stdout uncovers a critical <b>zero-click vulnerability</b>, codenamed <i>ShadowLeak</i>, in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent. Crafted emails leveraging <b>indirect prompt injection</b> could exfiltrate sensitive Gmail inbox data directly from OpenAI's cloud infrastructure, bypassing traditional client-side defences. This flaw, now patched, highlights risks with enabled third-party integrations. üìß</p>

<p>Next, we expose a widespread campaign targeting macOS users with the potent <b>Atomic Stealer malware</b>. Threat actors are deploying <b>fake GitHub repositories</b> impersonating legitimate tools like LastPass and 1Password, using <b>SEO poisoning</b> to push malicious downloads. This campaign underscores persistent social engineering and supply chain compromise tactics. üíª</p>

<p>Finally, a significant regulatory crackdown: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has shut down the <b>TradeOgre cryptocurrency exchange</b>, seizing over $40 million. This marks Canada's first crypto exchange shutdown, driven by failures in FINTRAC registration and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, making it a conduit for cybercrime money laundering. üí∞</p>]]></description>
